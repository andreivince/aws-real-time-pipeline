# Real-Time Market Data Pipeline

> **Live on AWS ¬∑ 2.3 M Lambda invocations in 88 min ¬∑ 53 ms p95 latency**  
> **Cost:** ‚âà \$1.19 per million events (14.1 M events ¬∑ June 2025)

A **minimal, production-grade serverless backend** that ingests high-frequency market ticks through AWS Lambda, persists them in DynamoDB, and proves you can hit serious load for pocket change.

Built and maintained by **Andrei Vince**.

## Why this project exists üöÄ
Open-source ‚Äúreal-time‚Äù demos often crumble above toy traffic or cost a fortune once requests pile up. **MarketStream** shows that an AWS-native design can:

* Handle **>30 k req / min** while staying under **150 ms p95**
* Cost **\< \$10 / million requests** (validated in Cost Explorer)
* Deploy end-to-end in **one CDK command**  

Use it as a template for trading bots, ETL spikes, or any write-heavy workload.

## Key features üîë

|  |  |
|---|---|
| ‚ö° **Performance** | 2.3 M events in 88 min ‚Ä¢ 53 ms p95 ‚Ä¢ 0 errors |
| üí∏ **Cost** | \$16.76 for 14.1 M invocations ‚Üí **\$1.19 / M** |
| üèóÔ∏è **IaC** | Entire stack defined with **AWS CDK (TypeScript)** |
| üîç **Observability** | CloudWatch Logs Insights queries provided |
| üñ•Ô∏è **Traffic simulator** | High-frequency script to reproduce the load |
| ü™∂ **Lightweight** | Only Lambda + DynamoDB + API Gateway REST |

*No fan-out, WebSocket, X-Ray, WAF, or CI/CD pipelines are included ‚Äî see Roadmap.*

## Quick start üõ†Ô∏è

### Prerequisites

* Node 18+ & npm
* AWS CLI configured (default profile)
* **AWS CDK v2** (`npm i -g aws-cdk`)

```bash
# 1 ‚Äì clone
git clone https://github.com/andreivince/aws-real-time-pipeline
cd aws-real-time-pipeline/cdk          # CDK app lives here

# 2 ‚Äì install deps
npm ci                                 # or `npm install` if no package-lock.json

# 3 ‚Äì bootstrap + deploy
npx cdk bootstrap && npx cdk deploy

# 4 ‚Äì simulate load  (optional)
cd traffic-simulator                             # run sendTIck.ts

```

After deploy, copy the API URL printed by CDK and create a `.env`:

```dotenv
INGEST_ENDPOINT=https://<api-id>.execute-api.<region>.amazonaws.com/prod/
```

The simulator reads that variable and fires authentic traffic.

## Roadmap üó∫Ô∏è

* [ ] **Fan-out Lambda** consuming DynamoDB Streams
* [ ] **WebSocket broadcaster** for real-time dashboards
* [ ] **Least-privilege IAM policies** (remove AdministratorAccess)
* [ ] **GitHub Actions** for synth + deploy + lint + test
* [ ] **CloudWatch alarms via CDK** (error > 0, cost > \$5)
* [ ] **Query endpoint** for historical reads
